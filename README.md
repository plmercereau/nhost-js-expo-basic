# Upgrading to 0.3.12 solved this


When using `@nhost/nhost-js` in vanilla React Native Expo for web (generated using expo version 5.0.3) starting the app fails with an error like this:

```
Web Bundling JavaScript [============================================================    ] 93%Using node to generate images. This is much slower than using native packages.
â€º Optionally you can stop the process and try again after successfully running `npm install -g sharp-cli`.

```

To reproduce the error:

1. yarn
2. yarn start
3. Press "w" to start as react native web app

App startup fails with the error above.

I successfully used `@nhost/nhost-js` with version `0.3.3` before, which included these packages:

```
"@nhost/hasura-auth-js@^0.1.8":
"@nhost/hasura-storage-js@^0.0.5":
"@nhost/nhost-js@^0.3.3":
```

The strange thing is that even if I now use the specific `"@nhost/nhost-js:0.3.3` version, which worked before, it would still fail with a similar error.

If I put back exactly these into my yarn.lock (copied form the project where the nhost-js worked) then it works again:
